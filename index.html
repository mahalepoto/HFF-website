                <h2>More About Us</h2>
                <p class="lead">The Halal Food Foundation (HFF) is a not for profit, registered UK charity 
                    (1139457). We aim to make the concept of
                ‘halal’ more accessible and well known to the public through training schemes,
                 workshops and educational material.
                
                We feel as though halal is more than just what you can and cannot eat – 
                it is important to understand why certain food
                stuffs are prohibited and why the concept of halal transcends to more than 
                just food.
                
                Education is key in administering such information and knowledge is indeed,
                power. Here at the HFF we are firm believers
                of the philosophy ‘give a man a fish, feed him for a day... teach a man to 
                fish and feed him for a lifetime’ – by
                forming effective relationships and networks together we can inform, engage
                 and enlighten others.
                
                Our charity was set up with a vision – a vision that sees more people 
                understanding the concepts of what halal is so
                that they too can appreciate the abundance of health benefits, cleanliness
                 and goodness of it.</p>
                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p class="lead">There is a gap in the Muslim community both within and outside of mosques,
                 schools and Islamic centres in providing
                appropriate educational resources and information on what halal is, 
                what makes food halal, how we know if food is halal
                and how to live a halal lifestyle. This gap was acknowledged by Halal Accreditation
                 Limited; the idea of an organisation
                that promotes halal and its various facets to mosques and schools as well as 
                the wider community was put forth and thus,
                the Halal Food Foundation was born in mid-2013.
                
                The HFF want a wider spectrum of the community to eat more halal food but
                 also to understand its importance in Islam. It
                is undoubtedly easier for many to not eat halal – why seek out halal 
                when you can go to your local supermarket and pick
                up any ready-made meal or piece of meat? Maintaining a halal diet requires
                 discipline and control but there is little
                extra effort needed to source halal meat / products due to the ever-increasing
                 halal industry (and the health benefits
                are abundant!).
                
                Education, therefore, is one of the HFF’s main aims – our charity is rooted
                 in the circulation of information and the
                development of understanding - we believe that halal does not just pertain to food,
                 we believe that halal is a
                lifestyle.
                
                To keep up to date with what we're doing and what is going on in the world of halal,
                 put your details into our
                subscription widget on the right and we will get in touch with you every month

                <h2>Apply For The Grant</h2>
                <p class="lead">Applications to the Halal Food Foundation can only
                be accepted from registered charities as recognised by the Charity
                Commission.
        
                Grant applications should be sent in a written format to HFF at
                Finchley House, 707 High Road, Finchley, London, N12
                0BT. There are two closing dates 30th April and 31st October each year.
                No further applications will be considered until each closing date
                has passed. After these closing dates applications will be forwarded
                in the first instance to a panel comprising trustees and advisors of
                HFF for their consideration. Applicants will be notified as soon
                as practical after each closing date.
        
                The application letter should comprise full details of the
                organisation, the grant requested, what it is for and how the
                grant will be spent, and any deadlines. Do not send any further
                information at this stage. If HFF requests further
                information, this should be provided as soon as possible.
                The average grant will never exceed £5,000 in any one year and
                in practise will be considerably less.
        
                When considering an application to HFF, ensure that your proposal
                match the aims of the HFF and within the spirit of the work of HFF.
                Make sure that your proposal is clear, accurate, and above all, honest.
        
                Only one application per charity may be made in any one year.
                Each grant is a discrete one-off payment with no
                undertaking that any further grant will be made to that group in
                the future, although it is free to apply again in subsequent years.
        
                If accepted and a grant is offered, the money will be transferred
                to the bank account of the applicant, upon receipt of
                an invoice from the charity at the time specified by HFF.</p>
